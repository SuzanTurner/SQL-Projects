# ðŸ“š [Books SQL Project](https://github.com/SuzanTurner/SQL-Projects/tree/main/Books) 

This project demonstrates SQL queries on a simple *Bookstore Database* built from three datasets:

- *Books.xlsx* â€“ book details (title, author, genre, price, stock, year)  
- *Orders.xlsx* â€“ customer orders (order date, quantity, total amount, book ID, customer ID)  
- *Customers.xlsx* â€“ customer information (name, country, city, etc.)  

The Excel sheets are imported into a relational database (PostgreSQL/SQLite/MySQL â€” any SQL engine works).  
After loading the data, a set of queries is executed to explore and analyze the bookstore.  

## ðŸš€ Features / Queries
- Retrieve books by genre, year, or price  
- Find customers from specific countries  
- Show orders within a date range  
- Calculate revenue, stock, and sales by genre/author  
- Identify top customers and most popular books  
- Advanced joins and aggregations across all three tables  

> Queries are written with PostgreSQL syntax (double quotes for identifiers).
> Should work with minimal changes on other SQL databases.
